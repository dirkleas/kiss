## getting support

getting support is easy...

1. reach out via **signal** with a text requesting support and what you need or are having issues with
1. once support time is confirmed, you'll receive text voice call
1. start **teamviewer** and share you new password via signal text during voice call
1. you'll be contacted via **teamviewer** and support begins
    1. start **mouse pointer highlight** and optionally **keyvis**
    1. interactive support will primarily be facilitated by supporter who'll be doing most keyboard and mouse work and providing detailed walkthrough what's happening -- of course, supportee will need to provide any required credentials

## roadmap

here's some upcoming possibilities:

1. command line interface (cli) with even more powerful features
1. record/edit support engagements with [obs]()[https://obsproject.com/] and post along with summaries, tags, etc. in searchable website with natural language interface for live q&a
1. optimize obs stack workflow with live-triggered markers for automated editing, including automatic removal of live research, off-topic tracks, and misspeaks, etc. via embedded markers
